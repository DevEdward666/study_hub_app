# Promo Selection for Session Start - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive promo selection system that allows users to apply promotional discounts when starting study sessions. The feature is integrated across all session start entry points in the application.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`src/hooks/PromoHooks.tsx`** - React Query hooks for promo data management
2. **`src/components/common/PromoSelector.tsx`** - Reusable promo selection component
3. **`src/services/promo.service.ts`** - Mock API service for promo operations

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/schema/table.schema.ts`** - Added `promoId` to `StartSessionRequestSchema`
2. **`src/pages/dashboard/TableScanner.tsx`** - Added promo selection to QR scanner session start
3. **`src/pages/tables/TableDetails.tsx`** - Added promo selection modal for manual session start
4. **`src/pages/TableManagement.tsx`** - Added promo selection to admin session start
5. **`src/pages/dashboard/TableScanner.css`** - Added CSS for promo discount styling

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Promo Hook System (`PromoHooks.tsx`)
- **useActivePromos()** - Fetches all currently active promos
- **useApplicablePromos(amount)** - Fetches promos applicable for a specific amount
- **calculatePromoDiscount()** - Calculates discount amount for a promo
- **isPromoValid()** - Validates if a promo is currently valid

### 2. PromoSelector Component (`PromoSelector.tsx`)
- **Intelligent filtering** - Only shows applicable promos based on session cost
- **Real-time discount calculation** - Updates discount as user selects different promos
- **Beautiful UI** - Gradient card design with chips for promo details
- **Validation** - Checks minimum purchase requirements and expiry dates
- **Quick selection** - Shows available promos as clickable chips

### 3. Schema Updates (`table.schema.ts`)
- Added optional `promoId` field to session start requests
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API

### 4. Integration Points

#### A. QR Scanner (`TableScanner.tsx`)
- **Promo selection** appears after hour selection in session confirmation modal
- **Dynamic cost calculation** showing original cost, discount, and final cost
- **Visual feedback** with green highlighting for savings
- **State management** resets promo selection when modal closes

#### B. Table Details (`TableDetails.tsx`)
- **Promo selection modal** opens before session confirmation
- **Detailed breakdown** showing hourly rate, discount, and final cost
- **Responsive design** with proper modal styling
- **Error handling** for insufficient credits consideration

#### C. Admin Table Management (`TableManagement.tsx`)
- **Admin promo selection** when starting sessions for users
- **Cost calculation** includes promo discounts in admin view
- **Enhanced summary** showing subtotal, discount, and total
- **State management** properly resets promo data

### 5. Mock Data Service (`promo.service.ts`)
- **Three sample promos**:
  - "First Timer" - 20% off for new users (max 5 credits)
  - "Happy Hour" - 5 credits fixed discount
  - "Weekend Study" - 15% off weekend sessions (max 10 credits)
- **Realistic validation** - checks dates, usage limits, minimum purchase
- **Ready for API integration** - structured for easy replacement with real endpoints

## Promo Types Supported

### Percentage Discounts
- **Configurable percentage** (e.g., 20% off)
- **Maximum discount cap** to prevent excessive savings
- **Minimum purchase requirement**

### Fixed Amount Discounts
- **Fixed credit reduction** (e.g., 5 credits off)
- **Cannot exceed session cost**
- **Minimum purchase requirement**

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- **Gradient promo cards** with modern design
- **Color-coded elements** - green for savings, blue for info
- **Animated card appearance** with slideInUp animation
- **Chip-based promo details** for easy scanning

### Smart Filtering
- **Automatic eligibility check** - only shows applicable promos
- **Real-time validation** - checks dates and usage limits
- **Dynamic cost updates** - immediate feedback on selections

### Error Prevention
- **Minimum purchase validation** - prevents invalid selections
- **Expiry date checking** - only shows valid promos
- **Usage limit enforcement** - prevents over-used promos

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **Consistent state handling** across all components
- **Proper cleanup** when modals close
- **Real-time updates** when promo selection changes

### API Integration Ready
- **Mock service** easily replaceable with real API
- **Proper error handling** structure in place
- **Query caching** with React Query for performance

### TypeScript Safety
- **Full type definitions** for all promo data structures
- **Compile-time validation** for promo properties
- **IntelliSense support** for better development experience

## Testing Data

The mock service includes three diverse promos for testing:

1. **First Timer (20% off)**
   - Min purchase: 10 credits
   - Max discount: 5 credits
   - Active for new users

2. **Happy Hour (5 credits off)**
   - Min purchase: 20 credits
   - Fixed discount amount
   - Time-based promotion

3. **Weekend Study (15% off)**

- **Flexible options** with multiple promo types

### For Administrators
- **Promotional control** through credits management system
- **Usage tracking** with built-in analytics

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Replace mock service** with actual API endpoints

The implementation provides a solid foundation for promotional features while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
